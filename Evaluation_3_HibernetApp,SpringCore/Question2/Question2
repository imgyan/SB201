1. What do you mean by the IOC ?

 Ans:-
        The full-form of IOC is Inversion of Control. And if some
        external entity is taking care of creating the dependency object then we
        say that control is inverted to some external entity,this is called IOC.

        In IOC an external entity provides the dependencies to the application
        components instead of hard coding them int component class.


   2. What is Dependency Injection ?

   Ans:-
         When external entity will push the dependency object to the dependent
         class then this is known as dependency injection.
         In Spring framework, the spring container is the external entity that will
         push the dependency object to the dependent class.

   3. Explain the life cycle of the Spring Bean ?

   Ans:-
         Spring container controls the life-cycle of a spring bean(from instantiation to
         destruction).

         Life-cycle of a spring bean has five stages:-

         1. Does not exist:-
                  Initially spring bean doesnot exist.

         2. Instantiated:-
                   All the dependencies will be resolved for a spring bean
                   before its instantiaton is finished.

         3. Initialized:-
                   In this phase initialization is done.

         4. Service:-
                   In this phase spring container provides the bean object reference
                   to the caller.

         5. Destroy:-
                   In this step spring container will call user-defined destroy
                   method if it is configured, just before instance is garbage
                   collected.
